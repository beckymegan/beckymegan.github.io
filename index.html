<!-- Hi! Thanks for checking out my portfolio. This was my first (real) attempt at
making a website without a WYSIWYG interface so the code may be a bit rough in places.
I used Bootstrap as a framework so that the site would be responsive and clean looking.
I also got the Javascript code for the scrolling animation from CSStricks.com. -->

							Ever go to a bookstore or library and pick up a random book, one you didn't recognize the name of but the art was cool or the description was super compelling? Then you get home and start reading, get a chapter or two in and realize that that not only was this book part of a series but this book was actually the third in a trilogy?
							<br><br>
							Series Finder solves this problem! When grabbing a new book simply scan the barcode (or type in the ISBN-13) and Series Finder will list all the books in that series, in order, highlighting your current book. Thus preventing you from accidentally reading a series out of order, or starting at part three of a trilogy!
						<br><br>
							Series Finder uses the Google Books API to find the title of the book based on the scanned ISBN and uses the Goodreads API to figure out if the book is part of a series. If it is the rest of the books in the series will be displayed, in order with an image of the book cover, and with the current book highlighted. Clicking on the title will bring up the description of the book (from Goodread) as well as larger image of the books cover.

							<i>When do you work best? What time of day do you get the most stuff done? When is your, personal, biological prime time?</i>
							<br><br>
							Productivity Tracker - When Do You Work Best? will help you figure that out! Simply enter in how productive you feel for less than a week and Productivity Tracker will tell you the best times for you to get stuff done. With it's simplistic user interface, and quick load times, Productivity Tracker will let you track your information and get back to your day in record time. Perfect for anyone who is curious when their biological prime time is!
							<br><br>
							Productivity Tracker is a reasonably simplistic CRUD app which allows the user to input how productive they’re feeling and the app then tracks and reports when the user is the most (and least) productive. Therefore showing the user what time of day would be best for said user to get shit stuff done. This idea was inspired by Thomas Frank of College Info Geeks video regarding biological prime times here. Productivity Tracker was built using Xamarin, a software package that allows native API access to Android, iOS, and Windows phone through C#. In plain English, Xamarin allows me to program in a language I know into multiple different mobile devices in the most effective. Even simpler, it’s pretty great.
							<br><br>
							The one truly major learning curve that I faced with Xamarin was learning how to use storyboards. Basically the entire user interface for the iOS apps made in Xamarin are created in the storyboard. My biggest issues with this was simply not understanding how constraints work, what the different elements were called (thought I needed TextView for text, turns out I needed label), and my datepicker was MIA for at least two-three days. That was frustrating. My biggest suggestion if anyone wants one, open up one of the example projects and screw around with that. I didn’t because “lol who needs examples” and as it turns out I do, I really needed too.
							<br><br>
							One of the highlights of working on Productivity Tracker for me was being able to practice using a database (SQLite) in a production app, or rather, an app that wasn't built for the sole purpose of using a database. I also enjoyed learning more about C# and Xamarin, a language I greatly enjoy working in and an excellent API that allowed me to develop for my favourite platform (mobile).

							Alieball is a high stress, high fun, local multiplayer, platform based, dodgeball game. Each player chooses a team and competes in either an all out, last team standing battle, or try to knock out as many other players as you can in five minutes (coming soon)!
							<br>
							Will your team be able to beat all the rest and come out on top? Invite some friends over, grab your controllers, and prepare to spend the next hour raging as your alien characters are pelted with balls from every direction conceivable in the battle to be the best!
							<br><br>
							The biggest challenges with Alieball so far are dealing with how Unity/Alieball deals with controllers, specifically Xbox 360 controllers, and general balancing. Since Alieball is my first game that utilizes controllers, as well as my first multiplayer (albeit local multiplayer) game. I have discovered that Unity, and therefore Alieball, has a very interesting way of dealing with controllers - specifically how they deal with axises (thumbsticks). This has not caused many issues in game when the player is moving around, however, this has caused numerous issues with moving between options in level select screens (the "cursor" moves too fast). General balancing has been an issue because games are hard to balance, especially when dealing with up to four different, very human, players. This can cause interesting issues when doing play testing and discovering how different players play Alieball.
							<br><br>
							For Alieball I have done all the coding, excluding the player controller, and also excluding the majority of the graphical assets. Alieball taught me how controllers work in Unity, how to work with multiplayer games, and how to "move" characters about. Since previously all of my applications had involved either tapping the screen (RainyDays) or clicking buttons (Magic and Battleship) having to move a character around is a very new experience.

							<i>Nothing ruins a picnic faster than rain clouds and an ant invasion! Help save the picnickers from a ruined day by tapping away the ants and clouds.

Regular updates keeps gameplay fresh and new, it’s a new adventure every time you play!</i>
							<br><br>
							Rainy Days is a single tap game where players have to quickly tap away clouds (the longer the clouds are on screen the faster the score drops) while also tapping away ants (if the ants get to the picnic basket the player loses health). Successfully tapping away a cloud or ant increases the player's score by one. Once a certain score is reached, dependent on the level, the level is medalled and the next level is unlocked. Gold medal if the player reaches the required score, with full health and under the time challenge, limit (which changes dependent on the level), silver medal if the player reaches the required score with full health but over the time challenge limit, and bronze medal if the player finishes with less than full health, regardless of the time taken to complete.
							<br><br>
							Rainy Days was my first (almost) totally self made project, with the music/sound effects being the only thing I didn't make. The biggest struggle that I faced with making an application by myself was having to learn how to do everything, with no one else to rely on. This was my first project in Unity, as well as my first project written in C#, so I had to trial/error every part of the project. I learned a lot through this project, including the process of submitting an application to both the Google Play Store and iTunes.
