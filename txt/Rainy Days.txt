Rainy Days is a single tap game where players have to quickly tap away clouds (the longer the clouds are on screen the faster the score drops) while also tapping away ants (if the ants get to the picnic basket the player loses health). Successfully tapping away a cloud or ant increases the player's score by one. Once a certain score is reached, dependent on the level, the level is medalled and the next level is unlocked. Gold medal if the player reaches the required score, with full health and under the time challenge, limit (which changes dependent on the level), silver medal if the player reaches the required score with full health but over the time challenge limit, and bronze medal if the player finishes with less than full health, regardless of the time taken to complete.

Rainy Days was my first (almost) totally self made project, with the music/sound effects being the only thing I didn't make. The biggest struggle that I faced with making an application by myself was having to learn how to do everything, with no one else to rely on. This was my first project in Unity, as well as my first project written in C#, so I had to trial/error every part of the project. I learned a lot through this project, including the process of submitting an application to both the Google Play Store and iTunes.
