#ProjectTowerHogg is my latest, currently work in progress, local multiplayer, couch co-op, game. #ProjectTowerHogg allows for up to four players, one keyboard and three controllers, to all play together on a single screen (no split screen required). The goal of #ProjectTowerHogg is to be the last man standing where each successful rocket ball hit dropping a player's health by one. The catch? Each player only has one rocket ball so if the player misses an opponent they have to run over and pick up their rocket ball before shooting again. THis keeps tension high as well as encouraging players to think before they shoot.

The biggest challenges with #ProjectTowerHogg so far are dealing with how Unity/#ProjectTowerHogg deals with controllers, specifically Xbox 360 controllers, and general balancing. Since #ProjectTowerHogg is my first game that utilizes controllers, as well as my first multiplayer (albeit local multiplayer) game. I have discovered that Unity, and therefore #ProjectTowerHogg, has a very interesting way of dealing with controllers - specifically how they deal with axises (thumbsticks). This has not caused many issues in game when the player is moving around, however, this has caused numerous issues with moving between options in level select screens (the "cursor" moves too fast). General balancing has been an issue because games are hard to balance, especially when dealing with up to four different, very human, players. This can cause interesting issues when doing play testing and discovering how different players play #ProjectTowerHogg.

For #ProjectTowerHogg I have done all the coding, excluding the player controller, and also excluding majority of the graphical assets. #ProjectTowerHogg, although still being a work in progress, has already taught me how controllers work in Unity, how to work with multiplayer games, and how to "move" characters about. Since previously all of my applications had involved either tapping the screen (RainyDays) or clicking buttons (Magic and Battleship) having to move a character around is a very new experience.
